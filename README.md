# Introduction ###
Discriminative power and generalization capabilities of convolutional networks is vital for deployment of semantic segmentation systems in the wild. These properties can be obtained by training a single net on multiple datasets.

Combined training on multiple datasets is hampered by a variety of reasons, mainly including:
* different level-of-detail of labels (e.g. *person* label in *dataset A* and *pedestrian* and *rider* labels in *dataset B*)
* different annotation types (e.g. *per-pixel* annotations in *dataset A* and *bounding box* annotations in *dataset B*)
* class imbalances between datasets (e.g. class person has 10^3 annotated pixels in *dataset A* and 10^6 pixels in *dataset B*)

We propose to construct a hierarchy of classifiers to combat above challenges. Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation is based on ResNet50. Its main novelty compared to other semantic segmentation systems, is that a single model can handle a variety of different datasets, with disjunct sets of semantic classes. Our system also runs in real time 20fps @512x1024 resolution. Figures 1-3 below provide sample results, from 3 different datasets.

__Figure 1.__ Cityscapes validation split image examples - __top: input images, center: predictions, bottom: ground truth__. The network predictions include decisions from L1-L3 levels of the hierarchy. Note that the ground truth includes only one traffic sign superclass (yellow) and no road attribute
markings.
